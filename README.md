Paper: 2425634.pdf

main.m: The purpose of this program is to build a constant model, which is the core of this series of programs

main1.m: The purpose of this program is to build a dynamic model, which is the core of this series of programs

main2.m: The purpose of this program is to draw a comparison diagram of dynamic and static models

main3.m: The purpose of this program is to discuss the interaction between parasites and adult lampreys in a dynamic model. See main7.m for information on a constant model

main4.m: The purpose of this program is to calculate the biomass of each species and the relative abundance based on biomass, from which the Shannon index is calculated and plotted

main5.m: The purpose of this program is to discuss the change of dynamical system equilibrium and stability with r in a constant model

main6.m: The purpose of this program is to analyze the sensitivity of constant and dynamic models in main,main1

main7.m: The purpose of this program is to discuss the interaction between parasites and adult lampreys in a constant model. See main3.m for dynamic models
